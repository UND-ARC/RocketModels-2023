### When editing files
Since files are stored as binary (unreadable to humans) it is important that no two file have a merge conflict. This can be done by "locking" a file when we edit it which prevents others from making changes to it at the same time.

To Lock a file, right click in the folder the file is in and select "Git bash here". Then enter the command:
`lfs lock FILENAME.Ext`
To Unlock a file use the command:
`git lfs unlock FILENAME.Ext`
The command `ls` will list all the files in the current folder if you don't know the extension.
